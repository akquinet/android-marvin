Marvin is an integration testing framework for Android.

Compared to other Android testing frameworks, Marvin focuses on testing program
flows involving multiple activities and the interaction between them.
Without having to dive into the details of Android Instrumentation, one
can write powerful tests that are easy to read and maintain, through the use
of Marvin's simple API.

Marvin also eases testing your business logic encapsulated in Android services.
